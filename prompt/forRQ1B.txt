Then, from your previous answer, remove these elements from the code but keep the functionality that use only A1-B2 competency level

Tell me the original code and the replaced code so I can put correct place. Finally, Give reason why you change like this 

For example, 
Original code: 
	dict_start = {file.name: file.value for file in filename} 
Fixed code: 
	dict_start = {} 
	for file in filename: 
		dict_start[file.name] = file.value
