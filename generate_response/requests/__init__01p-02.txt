The code you are interested in refactoring is the `cryptography_version = list(map(int, cryptography_version.split(".")))` line. To replace it with code that uses only A1-B2 competency level, we'll break it down into simpler steps.

### Original Code:
```python
cryptography_version = list(map(int, cryptography_version.split(".")))
```

### Refactored Code:
```python
cryptography_version_parts = cryptography_version.split(".")
cryptography_version = []
for part in cryptography_version_parts:
    cryptography_version.append(int(part))
```

### Reason for the Change:
The original code uses the `map` function, which might be considered advanced for A1-B2 competency level. The refactored code breaks the task into more explicit and simpler steps:
1. Splitting the version string into parts.
2. Initializing an empty list.
3. Looping through each part of the split version string.
4. Converting each part to an integer and appending it to the list.

This approach avoids the use of higher-order functions and should be more understandable for someone at an A1-B2 competency level in Python.

Would you like me to apply this change to the entire `__init__.py` file and provide the modified code?
