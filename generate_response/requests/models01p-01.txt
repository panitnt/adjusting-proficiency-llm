The file is too large to display all at once. To extract specific code elements, I will use a systematic approach to identify the required elements: Generator Expression, Generator Function (yield), and Simple Dictionary Comprehension.

Let's proceed to search for these elements within the code.

1. **Generator Expressions**:
2. **Generator Functions (yield)**:
3. **Simple Dictionary Comprehensions**:

I'll write a script to extract these elements from the provided code.

Here are the extracted code elements from the provided `models.py` file:

### Generator Expressions
- `(h for h in hook if isinstance(h, Callable))`

### Generator Functions (yield)
- `yield from self.raw.stream(chunk_size, decode_content=True)`
- `yield chunk`
- `yield from lines`
- `yield pending`

### Simple Dictionary Comprehensions
- `{attr: getattr(self, attr, None) for attr in self.__attrs__}`
