Certainly! Here are the steps to replace the code elements with simpler alternatives:

### Original Code and Replaced Code

#### Super Function
**Original Code:**
```python
super().__init__()
super().__init__()
```

**Replaced Code:**
```python
BaseClass.__init__(self)
BaseClass.__init__(self)
```

**Reason:**
The `super()` function is used to call a method from the parent class in a more dynamic way. However, for simplicity and to match the A1-B2 competency level, you can directly call the parent class's `__init__` method.

#### Simple Dictionary Comprehension
**Original Code:**
```python
return {attr: getattr(self, attr, None) for attr in self.__attrs__}
```

**Replaced Code:**
```python
result = {}
for attr in self.__attrs__:
    result[attr] = getattr(self, attr, None)
return result
```

**Reason:**
Dictionary comprehensions provide a concise way to create dictionaries. For simpler understanding, we can replace it with a basic `for` loop to achieve the same functionality.

### Contextual Replacement in the File
Here is how you can apply the changes to the relevant parts of your file:

#### Original Code Context
```python
class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def some_method(self):
        super().__init__()
        
    def to_dict(self):
        return {attr: getattr(self, attr, None) for attr in self.__attrs__}
```

#### Replaced Code Context
```python
class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    def __init__(self):
        BaseClass.__init__(self)

    def some_method(self):
        BaseClass.__init__(self)
        
    def to_dict(self):
        result = {}
        for attr in self.__attrs__:
            result[attr] = getattr(self, attr, None)
        return result
```

### Explanation for Changes
1. **super() Function**: Using `super()` is a dynamic way to ensure that the correct method from the parent class is called, especially in multiple inheritance scenarios. However, explicitly calling `BaseClass.__init__(self)` simplifies the understanding for learners who might not be familiar with `super()`.

2. **Dictionary Comprehension**: Dictionary comprehensions are a shorthand to create dictionaries but might be less readable for beginners. Expanding it into a `for` loop makes it clearer and more straightforward to understand each step of the dictionary creation process.
