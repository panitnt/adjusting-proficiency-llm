Let's proceed with modifying the code to remove the specified elements while keeping the functionality as simple as possible.

### Generator Function (yield)
#### Original Code:
```python
yield req
```
#### Fixed Code:
```python
return req
```
#### Reason:
Using `return` instead of `yield` returns the item and stops the function, which simplifies the code.

#### Original Code:
```python
yield resp
```
#### Fixed Code:
```python
return resp
```
#### Reason:
Similarly, using `return` provides the result directly without needing the generator's complexity.

### List Comprehension with If statements
#### Original Code:
```python
none_keys = [k for (k, v) in merged_setting.items() if v is None]
```
#### Fixed Code:
```python
none_keys = []
for k, v in merged_setting.items():
    if v is None:
        none_keys.append(k)
```
#### Reason:
This breaks down the list comprehension into a simple loop with an if condition, making it more understandable.

#### Original Code:
```python
keys_to_move = [k for k in self.adapters if len(k) < len(prefix)]
```
#### Fixed Code:
```python
keys_to_move = []
for k in self.adapters:
    if len(k) < len(prefix):
        keys_to_move.append(k)
```
#### Reason:
Again, breaking the comprehension into a loop with a condition improves readability for beginners.

### Simple Dictionary Comprehension
#### Original Code:
```python
state = {attr: getattr(self, attr, None) for attr in self.__attrs__}
```
#### Fixed Code:
```python
state = {}
for attr in self.__attrs__:
    state[attr] = getattr(self, attr, None)
```
#### Reason:
Converting the dictionary comprehension into a loop makes it easier to follow.

### Simple List Comprehension
#### Original Code:
```python
history = [resp for resp in gen]
```
#### Fixed Code:
```python
history = []
for resp in gen:
    history.append(resp)
```
#### Reason:
This conversion to a loop removes the complexity of comprehension, making the process more explicit.

### Summary of Changes:
#### Original:
```python
yield req
yield resp
none_keys = [k for (k, v) in merged_setting.items() if v is None]
keys_to_move = [k for k in self.adapters if len(k) < len(prefix)]
state = {attr: getattr(self, attr, None) for attr in self.__attrs__}
history = [resp for resp in gen]
```
#### Fixed:
```python
return req
return resp
none_keys = []
for k, v in merged_setting.items():
    if v is None:
        none_keys.append(k)
keys_to_move = []
for k in self.adapters:
    if len(k) < len(prefix):
        keys_to_move.append(k)
state = {}
for attr in self.__attrs__:
    state[attr] = getattr(self, attr, None)
history = []
for resp in gen:
    history.append(resp)
```
#### Reason:
These changes simplify the code by breaking down comprehensions and generator functions into basic loops and return statements, making the code more accessible for those with A1-B2 competency levels.
