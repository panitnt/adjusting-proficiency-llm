Here are the generator expressions found in the `utils.py` file:

1. `netrc_locations = (f"~/{f}" for f in NETRC_FILES)`
2. `no_proxy = (host for host in no_proxy.replace(" ", "").split(",") if host)`

These are the lines containing the generator expressions. If you need any further assistance or additional elements to extract, feel free to let me know!


Here are the lines containing generator functions (yield) found in the file `utils.py`:

- `yield tmp_handler`
- `yield from iterator`
- `yield rv`
- `yield rv`
- `yield string[pos : pos + slice_length]`
- `Save previous value, yield, and then restore the previous value stored in` (contextual line, not an actual code line with `yield`)
- `yield`


The relevant sections of the code containing the `import re` and `import struct` modules are:

```python
import re
import struct
```

These lines indicate that both the `re` and `struct` modules are imported in the `utils.py` file. If you need further assistance or another extraction, let me know!


The Python file provided is too large to process in one go. I will identify and extract simple dictionary comprehensions from the readable portion of the code. 

Here is the readable portion of the code:

```python
def dict_from_cookiejar(cj):
    """Returns a key/value dictionary from a CookieJar.

    :param cj: CookieJar object to extract cookies from.
    :rtype: dict
    """

    cookie_dict = {cookie.name: cookie.value for cookie in cj}
    return cookie_dict
```

From the readable portion, I identified one simple dictionary comprehension:

- `cookie_dict = {cookie.name: cookie.value for cookie in cj}`

Would you like me to attempt to process the file in smaller chunks to ensure all dictionary comprehensions are captured, or is this single occurrence sufficient?
