I will extract the generator expressions from the provided Python file. Let's start by loading and analyzing the file.

Here is the process to extract the requested elements:

1. Read the content of the file.
2. Identify and extract the generator expressions from the content.
3. Provide the extracted generator expressions as the output.

Let's begin:

First, I will read the content of the file.

The initial content provides a glimpse into the file structure and its components. To extract generator expressions from the entire file, I will search for patterns typically associated with generator expressions.

Let's continue to extract the generator expressions.

It appears I forgot to import the necessary library for data manipulation. Let me correct that and proceed with displaying the generator expressions.

Here are the generator expressions extracted from the provided Python file:

1. `names = ", ".join(f"``{n}``" for n in _codes[code])`
2. `__doc__ + "\\n" + "\\n".join(doc(code) for code in sorted(_codes))`

If you need further assistance or additional code elements extracted, please let me know!
