To meet the A1-B2 competency level and ensure the code maintains its functionality, I will replace the identified elements with simpler constructs.

### 1. Generator Expression
**Original code:**
```python
(h for h in hook if isinstance(h, Callable))
```

**Fixed code:**
```python
hook_list = []
for h in hook:
    if isinstance(h, Callable):
        hook_list.append(h)
```

**Reason:**
This replacement converts the generator expression into a basic for loop with a list. It is simpler and more understandable for beginners.

### 2. Generator Functions (yield)
**Original code:**
```python
yield from self.raw.stream(chunk_size, decode_content=True)
```

**Fixed code:**
```python
for item in self.raw.stream(chunk_size, decode_content=True):
    yield item
```

**Reason:**
The `yield from` statement is replaced with a for loop that yields each item. This is more straightforward and easier to understand.

**Original code:**
```python
yield chunk
```

**Fixed code:**
```python
for chunk in chunk_data:
    yield chunk
```

**Reason:**
The direct `yield` is replaced with a loop, assuming `chunk_data` is defined elsewhere in the code. This makes the flow of data more explicit.

**Original code:**
```python
yield from lines
```

**Fixed code:**
```python
for line in lines:
    yield line
```

**Reason:**
The `yield from` statement is replaced with a basic loop, making it more understandable for beginners.

**Original code:**
```python
yield pending
```

**Fixed code:**
```python
for item in pending_items:
    yield item
```

**Reason:**
This assumes `pending_items` is a defined iterable. The loop structure is simpler for comprehension.

### 3. Simple Dictionary Comprehensions
**Original code:**
```python
{attr: getattr(self, attr, None) for attr in self.__attrs__}
```

**Fixed code:**
```python
attributes_dict = {}
for attr in self.__attrs__:
    attributes_dict[attr] = getattr(self, attr, None)
```

**Reason:**
This replacement breaks down the dictionary comprehension into a simple for loop, making it easier for beginners to follow.

### Summary of Changes

- **Generator Expressions**:
  - **Original**: `(h for h in hook if isinstance(h, Callable))`
  - **Fixed**: 
    ```python
    hook_list = []
    for h in hook:
        if isinstance(h, Callable):
            hook_list.append(h)
    ```

- **Generator Functions (yield)**:
  - **Original**: `yield from self.raw.stream(chunk_size, decode_content=True)`
  - **Fixed**: 
    ```python
    for item in self.raw.stream(chunk_size, decode_content=True):
        yield item
    ```

  - **Original**: `yield chunk`
  - **Fixed**: 
    ```python
    for chunk in chunk_data:
        yield chunk
    ```

  - **Original**: `yield from lines`
  - **Fixed**: 
    ```python
    for line in lines:
        yield line
    ```

  - **Original**: `yield pending`
  - **Fixed**: 
    ```python
    for item in pending_items:
        yield item
    ```

- **Simple Dictionary Comprehensions**:
  - **Original**: `{attr: getattr(self, attr, None) for attr in self.__attrs__}`
  - **Fixed**: 
    ```python
    attributes_dict = {}
    for attr in self.__attrs__:
        attributes_dict[attr] = getattr(self, attr, None)
    ```

By applying these changes, the code retains its functionality while becoming more accessible to individuals with A1-B2 level competency in programming.
