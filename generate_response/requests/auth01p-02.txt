Certainly! I will go through the code and replace elements using only A1-B2 competency level. Hereâ€™s the modified code along with explanations:

```python
import re
```

### Modified Code:
We will use the `re` module in a more straightforward way without changing the usage. Since `re` is just an import statement, we don't need to simplify it further for A1-B2 competency level, as importing a module is already at a basic level of Python usage.
