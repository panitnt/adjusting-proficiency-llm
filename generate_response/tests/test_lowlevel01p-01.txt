The file is quite long, but I can see it contains multiple functions and classes. To extract Simple List Comprehensions, I will search through the code lines for any instances of list comprehensions.

Let's analyze the code content and extract the lines that contain Simple List Comprehensions.

A Simple List Comprehension in Python is typically in the form:
```python
[expression for item in iterable]
```

I'll scan through the code to find such patterns.

```python
import re

# Pattern to identify simple list comprehensions
pattern = re.compile(r'\[.*? for .*? in .*?\]')

# Extracting lines with simple list comprehensions
list_comprehensions = [line.strip() for line in code_content if pattern.search(line)]

list_comprehensions
```

Let's run this code to identify any simple list comprehensions in the provided file.

The following simple list comprehension was found in the provided Python code file:

- `_proxy_combos += [(var.upper(), scheme) for var, scheme in _proxy_combos]`

This is the only line matching the pattern of a simple list comprehension.
