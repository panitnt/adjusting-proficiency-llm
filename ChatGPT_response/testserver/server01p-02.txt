It appears that the modification attempt did not yield the expected results. Let's correct the approach by replacing the `super` function calls manually, ensuring that we maintain the functionality while adhering to an A1-B2 competency level.

Here's the original code and the modified code:

### Original Code:
```python
# Example lines from the original code with `super()` calls
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

class AnotherClass(AnotherBaseClass):
    def __init__(self, param):
        super().__init__(param)
```

### Modified Code:
```python
# Example lines modified to not use `super()`
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    def __init__(self):
        BaseClass.__init__(self)

class AnotherClass(AnotherBaseClass):
    def __init__(self, param):
        AnotherBaseClass.__init__(self, param)
```

### Reason for Change:
The `super()` function is a more advanced feature of Python used to call methods from a parent class. For A1-B2 competency levels, it is simpler to call the parent class's method directly using `ParentClass.method(self, args)`. This approach maintains the same functionality while using simpler syntax.

I will now apply these changes to the actual lines found in the `server.py` file.

### Modified Sections:

#### 1. Original:
```python
super().__init__()
```
#### Fixed:
```python
BaseClass.__init__(self)
```

#### 2. Original:
```python
super().__init__(param)
```
#### Fixed:
```python
BaseClass.__init__(self, param)
```

I will now implement these changes directly into the provided `server.py` file and create the modified version for you.

I have modified the code to replace the `super` function calls with direct calls to the parent class's `__init__` method. Below are the details of the changes:

### Original Code:
```python
super().__init__()
```
### Fixed Code:
```python
BaseClass.__init__(self, )
```

### Original Code:
```python
super().__init__(
```
### Fixed Code:
```python
BaseClass.__init__(self,
```

### Reason for Change:
The `super()` function is used to call the parent class's method, which is a more advanced feature. For A1-B2 competency levels, it's simpler and clearer to call the parent class's method directly using `ParentClass.method(self, args)`. This approach maintains the same functionality while using syntax that is easier to understand for beginners.
