Sure! Here is the original code and the revised version without using the `super` function but maintaining the same functionality at an A1-B2 competency level.

### Original Code:
```python
class RequestException(IOError):
    """There was an ambiguous exception that occurred while handling your
    request.
    """

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """Initialize RequestException with `request` and `response` objects."""
        response = kwargs.pop("response", None)
        self.response = response
        self.request = kwargs.pop("request", None)
        if response is not None and not self.request and hasattr(response, "request"):
            self.request = self.response.request
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

class JSONDecodeError(InvalidJSONError, CompatJSONDecodeError):
    """Couldn't decode the text into json"""

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Construct the JSONDecodeError instance first with all
        args. Then use it's args to construct the IOError so that
        the json specific args aren't used as IOError specific args
        and the error message from JSONDecodeError is preserved.
        """
        CompatJSONDecodeError.__init__(self, *args)
        InvalidJSONError.__init__(self, *self.args, **kwargs)
```

### Revised Code:
```python
class RequestException(IOError):
    """There was an ambiguous exception that occurred while handling your
    request.
    """

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """Initialize RequestException with `request` and `response` objects."""
        response = kwargs.pop("response", None)
        self.response = response
        self.request = kwargs.pop("request", None)
        if response is not None and not self.request and hasattr(response, "request"):
            self.request = self.response.request
        IOError.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)

class JSONDecodeError(InvalidJSONError, CompatJSONDecodeError):
    """Couldn't decode the text into json"""

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Construct the JSONDecodeError instance first with all
        args. Then use it's args to construct the IOError so that
        the json specific args aren't used as IOError specific args
        and the error message from JSONDecodeError is preserved.
        """
        CompatJSONDecodeError.__init__(self, *args)
        InvalidJSONError.__init__(self, *self.args, **kwargs)
```

### Reason for Changes:
- The `super()` function provides a cleaner and more concise way to call a method from a parent class, especially in multiple inheritance scenarios. However, at the A1-B2 competency level, the `super()` function may be less familiar and more difficult to understand.
- Replacing `super()` with direct parent class references (`IOError.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)` and similarly for `CompatJSONDecodeError` and `InvalidJSONError`) maintains the functionality while making the code more explicit and straightforward. This approach is more suitable for beginners who might not be comfortable with the `super()` function and multiple inheritance nuances.
