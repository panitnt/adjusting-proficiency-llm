The content of the file is too large to process in one go. I'll break it down into chunks to identify and extract the required code elements: generator functions (yield), simple list comprehensions, and the use of the `super` function.

Let's process the content in parts to find these elements.

Here are the extracted code elements from the `cookies.py` file:

### Generator Functions (yield):
1. `yield cookie.name`
2. `yield cookie.value`
3. `yield cookie.name, cookie.value`

### Simple List Comprehensions:
1. `names_from_jar = [cookie.name for cookie in cookiejar]`

### Super Function:
1. `return super().__contains__(name)`
2. `return super().set_cookie(cookie, *args, **kwargs)`
3. `super().update(other)`

Is there anything else you would like to extract or analyze from this file?
