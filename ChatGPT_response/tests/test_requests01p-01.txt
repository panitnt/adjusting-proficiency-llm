Here are the generator expressions found in the provided Python file:

- `req = requests.Request("POST", httpbin("post"), data=(b"x" for x in range(1)))`
- `warnings_category = tuple(item.category.__name__ for item in warning_records)`
- `assert all(isinstance(chunk, str) for chunk in chunks)`
- `assert all(isinstance(chunk, str) for chunk in chunks)`
- `assert all(len(chunk) == 1 for chunk in chunks)`
- `data = (i for i in [b"a", b"b", b"c"])`
- `keyset = frozenset(lowerkey for lowerkey, v in cid.lower_items())`
- `assert frozenset(i[0] for i in cid.items()) == keyset`
- `assert frozenset(i[0] for i in cid.items()) == keyset`


The following code elements were found in the `test_requests.py` file:

- **Import 'pickle' module:**
  - `import pickle`
  
- **Import 're' module:**
  - `import re`

If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!


It looks like the content of the file is quite extensive. I'll parse through it to identify the specific code elements you requested: 

1. **List Comprehension with `if` statements**
2. **Simple List Comprehension**

I will now extract these elements from the content.

From the provided `test_requests.py` file, I found the following list comprehensions:

### Simple List Comprehensions:
- `urls = [r.url for r in resp.history]`
- `req_urls = [r.request.url for r in resp.history]`

### List Comprehensions with `if` Statements:
None were found in the provided code.

If you need further assistance or another type of code element extracted, please let me know!
